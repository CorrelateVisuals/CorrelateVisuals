W### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I'm focused on [parallel computation](https://synergy.cs.vt.edu/pubs/papers/feng-icpe12-opencl-13-dwarfs.pdf) and graphics programming, specializing in Vulkan, C++, and GLSL. My expertise extends to CUDA, OpenCL, Python and TouchDesigner for interactive visualizations. I'm dedicated to unleashing the potential of computer science through insightful data visualizations. Join me in exploring the realms of data-driven creativity and cutting-edge computational techniques. Let's collaborate to create impactful solutions and push the boundaries of visual representation in the digital age.
